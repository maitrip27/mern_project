This is a simple yet powerful Notes App built with Node.js. It supports both a Command-Line Interface (CLI) and a RESTful Web API using Express.js. The application allows users to create, read, update, and delete notes, with all data stored in a local notes.json file using the built-in fs module.

Update existing notes via API

Store notes persistently in notes.json
